# Outputting-multiple-elements-per-line
12 values have been input into list yearly_values. Output all 12 elements, with 4 per line.

If the elements are

10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120
the output is:

10 20 30 40
50 60 70 80
90 100 110 120
Hints:

Inside the for loop, just print all four elements. An inner loop could be used, but isn't necessary.
